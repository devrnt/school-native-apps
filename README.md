# City Pinboard

School project for the subject 'Native Apps: Android'.

This Android application makes it possible to post a 'post-it' on a 'virtual' pinboard for a corresponding city/village in Belgium. This project was created on 6/10/2018.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Clone the Repository
As usual, you get started by
 cloning the project to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/HoGentTIN/native-apps-1-android-creative-app-JonasDeVrient.git
```


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software

- Android Studio and an Android emulator

The emulator is recommended to have API 26

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Navigate to the main folder of the cloned repository and execute ```wake_up_heroku_backend.bat``` file.

This file sends a request to the backend, this is needed because the backend is hosted on Heroku and there is a free-host plan, but the server goes to sleep when there are no requests made.

2. Open Android Studio 
3. Open the project in Android studio by the following instructions
```
File -> Open -> [Select project in cloned repository] 
```
4. Run the application on the emulator
```
Run -> Run  
```
5. Create a new account in the app or use the account with username ``` jonas ``` and password ``` jonasjonas``` 

## Running the tests

1. Open Android Studio
2. Run the file ``` MainActivityTest ``` found in ``` app/java/com.jonasdevrient.citypinboard/ ```
